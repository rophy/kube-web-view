Welcome to Kubernetes Web View's documentation!
===============================================

Kubernetes Web View allows to list and view all Kubernetes resources (incl. CRDs) with permalink-friendly URLs in a plain-HTML frontend.
This tool was mainly developed to provide a web-version of kubectl for troubleshooting and supporting colleagues, see also :ref:`vision`.
